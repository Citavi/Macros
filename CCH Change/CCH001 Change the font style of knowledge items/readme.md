#  Changing the font style of knowledge items
 [[> Deutsche Version](readme.de.md)]

If you changed the default text style for formattable text fields under Tools > Options, you might want to change the font of your quotations and ideas back to the default at a later point in time. Unfortunately, this option has no effect on knowledge items already saved.

## Solution
To change the text style for knowledge items that were already saved, use the macro provided here.

## Download

[for Citavi 6](C6_Reformat_All_KnowledgeItems.cs)

[for Citavi 3, 4 and 5](C3+_Reformat_All_KnowledgeItems.cs)


## Usage
Follow the instructions in [this article](/readme.md) to run the macro.

The macro opens each knowledge item window and applies the following formatting:

> Font: Segoe UI
>
> Font size: 9 pt
>
> Alignment: left

Please note the following:

The macro cannot be stopped once it is running.
While the macro is running many windows will open and close. This is not an error; knowledge item windows should open and close when this macro is run.
