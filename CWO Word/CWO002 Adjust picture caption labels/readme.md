# Change image captions

[[> English Version](readme.md)]

You inserted image quotations with catpion in your document. These captions use different text (for example, "Figure" and "Image") that you would now like to unify.

## Please note

The different caption texts are a known Word problem and are due to the language settings in the global template, which Citavi has no control over. We offer this macro as a workaround for Citavi users.
 
Whenever proofing tools in additional languages are installed, additional caption text is saved in the global template (normal.dot). If these languages are removed, the original image caption text will appear again whenever an image quotation is inserted. This solution does not change already inserted captions, though. To correct these, you'll need to use this macro. 

## Solution
This macro for Microsoft Word can correct all the captions in your document at once.

## Download
[Word template](FixCaptions.dotm)

## Use

1. Download the Word template.
1. Start Word and open the file `DateiFixCaptions.dotm`.
1. Follow the steps in the document.
